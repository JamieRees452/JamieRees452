### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Jamie Rees
#### PhD Student

I'm Jamie from the University of Oxford, researching in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics.

My thesis title is:
  "Investigating the stability of meridionally and vertically varying zonal jets near the equator"

Skills: Python / MATLAB

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on numerical solutions to linear stability problems associated with two-dimensional equatorial zonal flows
- ðŸŒ± In my spare time I am working on some basic projects in machine learning to help develop my understanding of the topic
